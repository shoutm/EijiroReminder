= EijiroReminder

== About this software
This is purposed for helping remembering English words which you
have learned in Eijiro Pro.

I adopted "Spaced Repetition" methods in this software. English words
you've learned will be e-mailed to you in appropriate interval so that
you can be reminded when you might forget them.

See http://eowp.alc.co.jp/info/ for more details about Eijiro Pro.
